of linguistic information through a different approach .\nMapping Domain taxonomy onto Upper Model : ILEX uses an Upper Model -LRB- a domainindependent semantic taxonomy , see Bateman -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- , which supports the grammatical expression of entities , e.g. , selection of pronoun , differentiation between mass and count entities , between things and qualities , etc. .\nWith the choice of a head lexical unit , the salience of the arguments is also predetermined -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- .\nIn order to interface with such information , however , we provide a general subsumption hierarchy

-LRB- -RRB- -RRB- , from one technical domain to the next .\nPENMAN provides structure for some of these external sources of information , including a conceptual hierarchy of relations and entities , called the UpperModel -LRB- UM -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ; the UM hierarchy classifies concepts according to their possibilities for realization in natural language and may be used as an interface between the organizational structures of Domain Knowledge -LRB- DK -RRB- and the grammar \u0027s inquiries .\nThe Ontology Base is a synthesis of USC/ISI \u0027s PENMAN Upper Model -LRB- -RRB- .\nTo enhance the semantic processing in MT systems , many system include conceptual networks called ontologies or semantic taxonomies -LRB- -RRB- .\nThe knowledge base also contains a linguistically motivated concept

.\n","body":"MUMBLE-86 and PENMAN range , property-ascription -RRB- and the respective domain roles and concepts -LRB- e.g. , system , faulty , input , destination , sail , ship , inoperative -RRB- .\nBoth forms are rendered interpretable by the subordination of the domain concepts to the single generalized hierarchy of the upper model .\nThis is illustrated graphically in Figure 3 .\nHere we see the single hierarchy of the upper model being used to subordinate concepts from the two domains .\nThe domain concept system , for example , is subordinated to the upper model concept object , domain concept inoperative to upper model concept quality , etc. .\nBy virtue of these subordinations , the grammar and semantics of the generator can interpret the input specifications in order to produce appropriate linguistic realizations : the upper model concept object licenses a particular set of realizations , as do the concepts quality , material-process , etc. .\nOur present upper model contains approximately 200 Input for digital circuit example sentence : The faulty system is connected to the input Input for navy example sentence : The ship which was inoperative is sailing to Sasebo such categories , as motivated by the requirements of the grammar , and is organized as a structured inheritance lattice represented in the LOOMknowledge representation language -LSB- MacGregor and Bates , 1987 -RSB- .\nGenerally , the upper model represents the speaker \u0027s experience in terms of generalized linguistically-motivated ` ontological \u0027 categories .\nMore specifically , the following information is required -LRB- with example categories drawn from the current PENMANupper model -RRB- : • abstract specifications of process-type/relations and configurations of participants and circumstances -LRB- e.g. , NONDIRECTEDACTION , ADDRESSEE-ORIENTED-VERBAL-PROCESS , ACTOR , SENSER , RECIPIENT , SPATIO-TEMPORAL , CAUSAL-RELATION , GENERALIZED-MEANS -RRB- , • abstract specifications of object types , for , e.g. , semantic selection restrictions -LRB- e.g. , DECOMPOSABLE-OBJECT , ABSTRACTION , PERSON , SPATIAL-TEMPORAL -RRB- , • abstract specifications of quality types , and the types of entities which they may relate -LRB- e.g. , BEHAVIORALQUALITY , SENSE-AND-MEASURE ` QUALITY , STATUSQUALITY -RRB- , • abstract specifications ofcombinations of events -LRB- e.g. , DISJUNCTION , EXEMPLIFICATION , RESTATEMENT -RRB- .\nThese are described in full in -LSB- Bateman et al. , 1990 -RSB- .\nAppropriate linguistic realizations are not in a oneto-one correspondence with upper model concepts , however .\nThe relationship needs to be rather more complex and so the question of justification of upper model concepts and organization becomes crucial .\nThe general semantic types defined by a level of meaning such as the upper model need to be ` linguistically responsible \u0027 , in that mappings between them and linguistic form may be constructed .\nIn addition , to be usable by an application , they must also be sufficiently operationalizable so as to support consistent coding of application knowledge .\nBoth of these requirements have tended to push the level of organization defined closer towards linguistic form .\nHowever , it is also crucial for this organization to be su ~ ciently abstract , i.e. , removed from linguistic form , so that it is possible for an application to achieve its classification purely on grounds of meaning .\nIt is thus inadequate to rely on form-oriented criteria for upper model construction because grammatical classifications are often non-isomorphic to semantic classifications : they therefore need to deviate from semantic organization in order to respect the syntactic criteria that define them .\nReliance on details of linguistic realization also compromises the design aim that the applications should not be burdened with grammatical knowledge , e eThis is also resonant with the design aim in text generation that higher level processes -- e.g. , text planners should not need direct access to lowlevelinformation suchas the grammar -LSB- Hovyet al. , 1988 -RSB- .\nFordescriptions ofall these Thus , the levelofabstractionofan upper model must be sufficientlyhigh that it generalizes across syntactic alternations , without being so high that the mapping between itand surfaceform isimpossible to state .\nThis tension between the requirements of abstractness and linguisticresponsibilitypresents perhaps the major point of general theoreticaldifficultyand interest for future developments of upper model-like levelsof meaning .\nWithout a resolution , substantive progress that goes beyond revisionsof what the PENMAN upper model already contains is unlikelyto be achieved .\nIt is essential for constraints to be found for what an upper model should contain and how it should be orga .\nnized so that an appropriate level of abstraction may be constructed .\nConstraining the Organization of an Figure 4 sets several methodologies have been pursued for uncovering the organization `` and contents of a level of meaning such as an upper model , with examples of approaches that have adopted them , along the continuum of abstraction from linguistic form to abstract ontology .\nWhile the problem of being too bound to linguistic form has been mentioned , there are also severe problems with attempts to construct an upper model independent of form and motivated by other criteria , e.g. , a logical theory of the organization of knowledge per se .\nWithout a strong theoretical connection to the linguistic system the criteria for organizing an abstraction hierarchy remain ill-specified ; there is very little guarantee that such systems will organize themselves in a way appropriate for interfacing well with the linguistic system .7 An alternative route is offered by the approaches in the middle of the continuum , i.e. , those which abstract beyond linguistic form but which still maintain a commitment to language as a motivating force .\nThis is further strengthened by the notion , now resurgent within current linguistics , that the organization of language informs us about the organization of ` knowledge \u0027 -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- HaUiday , 1978 ; Jackendoff , 1983 ; Langacker , 1987 ; Matthiessen , 1987 ; Talmy , 1987 -RSB- -RRB- : that is , the relation between grammar and semantics/meaning is not arbitrary .\nDetailed theories of grammar can then be expected to provide us with insights concerning the organization that is required for the level of meaning .\nWe have found that the range of meanings required to support one particular generalized functional region of distinctions in detail , see the PENMANdocumentation -LSB- The Penman Project , 1989 -RSB- .\n7Furthermore , the experience of the JANUSproject -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- Weischedel , 1989 -RSB- -RRB- has been that the cost of using a sufficiently rich logic to permit axiomatization of the complex phenomenonrequired is very high , motivating augmentation by an abstraction hierarchy very similar to that ofthe upper model and facing the same problem of definitional criteria .\nthe grammar developed within the PENMAN system provides a powerful set of organizing constraints concerning what an upper model should contain .\nIt provides for the representation of ` conceptual \u0027 meanings at a high level of abstraction while still maintaining a mapping to linguistic form .\nThis functional region corresponds with the Systemic Functional Linguistic notion of the experiential metafunction -LSB- Matthiessen , 19877 -RSB- , one of four generalized meaning types which are simultanously and necessarily made whenever language is used .\nAny sentence must contain contributions to its function from all four ` metafunctions \u0027 R each metafunction providing a distinct type of constraint .\nThe value of this factorization of distinct meaning types as far as the design of an upper model is concerned can best be seen by examining briefly what it ezcludes from consideration for inclusion within an upper model : i.e. , all information that is controlled by the remaining three metafunctions should not be represented .\nThe logical metaf ~ nction is responsible for the construction of composite semantic entities using the resources of interdependency ; it is manifested in grammar by dependency relationships such as those that hold between the head of a phrase and its dependents and the association of concepts to be expressed with particular heads in the sentence structure .\nThe removal of this kind of information permits upper model specifications to be independent of grammatical constituents and grammatical dominance relations .\nThis relaxes , for example , the mapping between objects and processes at the upper model level and nominals and verbals at the grammatical level , enabling generalizations to be captured concerning the existence of verbal participants in nominalizations , and permits the largely textual variations shown in -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- 8 to be removed from the upper model coding .\n-LRB- 1 -RRB- It will probably rain tomorrow It is fikely that it will rain tomorrow SExample taken from -LSB- Meteer , 1988 -RSB- .\nThere is a high probability that it will rain tomorrow -LRB- 2 -RRB- independently in a way that is independent No change in upper model representation or classification is required to represent these variations .\nThis can be seen more specifically by considering the following PENMAN input specification that uses only upper model terms : This states that there are two configurations of processes and participants -- one classified as an upper model directed-action , the other as a nondirected-action -- which are related by the upper model relationship cause-effect .\nNow , the assignment of concepts to differently ` ranked \u0027 heads in the grammar governs realization variants including the following : Electricity being discharged resulted in the system breaking down .\nBecause electricity was discharged , the system broke down .\nBecause of electricity being discharged the system broke down .\n... the breakdown of the system due to an electrical discharge ... Electricity was discharged causing the system to break down .\n... an electrical discharge causing the breakdown of the system ... etc. .\nMany such ` paraphrase \u0027 issues are currently of concern within the text generation community -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- Meteer , 1988 ; Iordanskaja et al. , 1988 ; Bateman and Paris , 1989 ; Bateman , 1989 -RSB- -RRB- .\nThe textual metafunction is responsible for the creation and presentation of text in context , i.e. , for establishing textual cohesion , thematic development , rhetorical organization , information salience , etc. .\nThe removal of this kind of information allows upper model specifications to be invariant with respect to their particular occasions of use in texts and the adoption of textually motivated perspectives , such as , e.g. , theme/rheme selections , definiteness , anaphora , etc. .\nThus , with the same input specification as above , the following variations are supported by varying the textual constraints : It was the electricity being discharged that resulted in the system breaking down .\nThe discharge of electricity resulted in the system breaking down .\nThe system breaking down -- the electricity being discharged did it !\netc. .\nThese textual variations are controlled during the construction of text -LRB- cf. -LSB- Matthiessen , 1987 ; Dale , 1989 ; Hovy and McCoy , 1989 ; Meteer , 1989 ; Bateman and Matthiessen , 1990 -RSB- -RRB- and , again , are factored out of the upper model .\nThe interpersonal metafunction is responsible for the speaker \u0027s interaction with the listener , for the speech act type of an utterance , the force with which it is expressed , etc. .\nThus , again with the same input specification , the following variants are possible : Did electricity being discharged result in the system breaking down ?\nElectricity being discharged resulted surprisingly in the whole damn thing breaking down .\n1 rather suspect that electricity being discharged may have resulted in the system breaking down .\netc. .\nThe metafunctional factorization thus permits the upper model to specify experiential meanings that are invariant with respect to the linguistic alternations driven by the other metafunetions .\nThat is , a specification in upper model terms is consistent with a set of linguistic realizations that may be regarded as ` experiential paraphrases \u0027 : the specification expresses the ` semantic \u0027 content that is shared across those paraphrases and often provides just the level of linguistically decommitted representation required for nonlinguistically oriented applications .\nGeneration of any unique surface realization is achieved by additionally respecting the functional constraints that the other metafunctions bring to bear ; particular surface forms are only specifiable when a complete set of constraints from each of the four metafunctions are combined .\nThe application of these constraints is directly represented in the PENMAN grammar , which provides for the perspicuous and modular integration of many disparate sources of information .\nThe interdependencies between these constraints and their conditions of applicability are also directly represented in the grammar .\nThis organization of the grammar allows us to construct a rather abstract upper model while still preserving the necessary mapping to linguistic form .\nThe value of achieving the abstract specification of meaning supported by the upper model is then that it permits a genuinely form-independent , but nevertheless form-constraining , ` conceptual \u0027 representation that can be used both as a statement of the semantic contents of an utterance and as an abstract specification of content for application domains that require linguistic output .\nA computational resource has been developed within the PENMAN text generation project that significantly simplifies control of a text generator .\nThis resource , called the upper model , is a hierarchy of concepts that captures semantic distinctions necessary for generating natural language .\nAlthough similar levels of abstract semantic organization are now being sought in many natural language systems , they are often built anew for each project , are to an unnecessary extent domain or theory specific , are required to fulfill an ill-determined set of functionalities , and lack criteria for their design .\nThis paper has presented the results of our experiences in designing and using the upper model in a variety of applications ; in particular , it presented our conclusions concerning the appropriate source of constraints concerning the organization of an upper model .\nWe have found that restricting the information contained in an upper model to experiential meaning has significantly improved our understanding of how a semantic hierarchy should be organized and how it needs to relate to the rest of the linguistic system .\nWe strongly feel , therefore , that subsequently constructed semantic organizations should follow the guidelines set out by the metafunctional hypothesis ; the factorization that it provides concerning what should , and should not , be represented in an ` abstract semantic knowledge \u0027 hierarchy supports functionalities well beyond those envisioned in current text generation/understanding systems .\nAcknowledgments The upper model has been under development for several years , and many have and continue to contribute to it .\nThe ideas I have reported on here would not have been possible without that development .\nThose responsible for the present form of the upper model include : William Mann , Christian Matthiessen , Robert Kasper , Richard Whitney , Johanna Moore , Eduard Hovy , Yigal Arens , and mysel # Thanks also to C ~ : ile Pads and Eduard Hovy for improving the paper \u0027s organization .\nFinancial support was provided by AFOSR contract F49620-87-C-0005 , and in part by DARPA contract MDA903-87-C-641 .\nThe opinions in this report are solely those of the author .\nReferences -LSB- Allgayer et al. , 1989 -RSB- JSrgen Allgayer , Karin Harbusch , Alfred Kobsa , Carola Reddig , Norbert Reithinger , and Dagmar Schmauks .\nXtra : a naturallanguage access system to expert systems .\nIntertute .\n-LSB- Chen and Cha , 1988 -RSB- Keh-Jiann Chen and Chuan-Shu Cha .\nThe design of a conceptual structure and its relation to the parsing of chinese sentences .\nIn Proceedings of the 1988 International Conference on Computer Processing of Chinese and Oriental Languages , Toronto , Canada , August 29 - September 1 1988 .\n-LSB- Dahlgren et at. , 1989 -RSB- Kathleen Dahlgren , Joyee MeDowell , and Edward P.

Mann , 1985 ; Moore and Arens , 1985 -RSB- .\nThe majority of natural language processing systems\ncurrently planned or under development are now recognizing the necessity of some level of abstract ` semantic \u0027\norganization similar to the upper model that classifies\nknowledge so that it may be more readily expressed\nlinguisticaUy .1 However , they mostly suffer from either\na lack of theoretical constraint concerning their internal\ncontents and organization and the necessary mappings\nbetween them and surface realization , or a lack of abstraction which binds them too closely with linguistic\nform .\nIt is important both that the contents of such\na level of abstraction be motivated on good theoretical\ngrounds and that the mapping between that level and\nlinguistic form is specifiable .\nOur extensive experiences with the implementation\nand use of a level of semantic organization of this kind\nwithin the PENMAN system now permit us to state some\nclear design criteria and a well-developed set of necessary functionalities .\nThe Upper Model \u0027s Contribution to the\nSolution to the Interface Problem :\nDomain independence and reusability\nThe upper model decomposes the mapping problem by\nestablishing a level of linguistically motivated knowledge organization specifically constructed as a reponse\nXIncluding , for example : the Functional Sentence Structure of XTRA : -LSB- Allgayer et al. , 1989 -RSB- ;

generally we refer to this level of organization as meaning rather than as knowledge in order to distinguish\nit from language-independent knowledge and to emphasize its tight connection with linguistic forms -LRB- cf.\n-LSB- Matthiessen , 1987:259 -260 -RSB- -RRB- .\nWhile it may not be reasonable to insist that application domains organize their\nknowledge in terms that respect linguistic realizations\n-- as this may not provide suitable orgunizations for ,\ne.g. , domain-internal reasoning -- we have found that\nit is reasonable , indeed essential , that domain knowledge be so organized if it is also to support expression\nin natural language relying on general natural language\nprocessing capabilities .\nThe general types constructed within the upper\nmodel necessarily respect generalizations concerning\nhow distinct semantic types can be realized .\nWe then\nachieve the necessary link between particular domain\nknowledge and the upper model by having an application classify its knowledge organization in terms of\nthe general semantic categories that the upper model\nprovides .\nThis does not require any expertise in grammar or in the mapping between upper model and grammar .\nAn application needs only to concern itself with\nthe ` meaning \u0027 of its own knowledge , and not with fine\ndetails of linguistic form .\nThis classification functions\nsolely as an interface between domain knowledge and\nupper model ; it does not interfere with domain-internal\norganization .\nThe text generation system is then responsible for realizing the semantic types of the level\nof meaning with appropriate grammatical forms , s Further , when this classification has been established for\na given application , application concepts can be used\nfreely in input specifications since their possiblities for\nlinguistic realization are then known .\nThis supports\ntwo significant functionalities :\n• interfacing with a natural language system is radically simplified since much of the information specific to language processing is factored out of the input specifications required and into the relationship\nbetween upper model and linguistic resources ;\n• the need for domain-specific linguistic processing\nrules is greatly reduced since the upper model provides a domain-independent , general and reusable\nconceptual organization that may be used to classify\nall domain-specific knowledge when linguistic processing is to be performed .\n~ Although my discussion here is oriented towards text\ngeneration , our current research aims at fully bi-directional\nlinguistic resources -LSB- Kasper , 1988 ; Kasper , 1989 -RSB- ; the mapping is therefore to be understood as a bi.directional mapping throughout .\n3This is handled in the PeNM * Nsystem by the grammar \u0027s\ninquiry semantics , which has been described and illustrated\nextensively elsewhere -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- Bateman , 1988 ; Mann , 1983 ;\nMatthiessen , 1988 -RSB- -RRB- .\nAn example of the simplification that use of the upper\nmodel offers for a text generation system interface language can be seen by contrasting the input specification\nrequired for a generator such as MUMBLE-86 -LSB- Meteer el\nal. , 1987 -RSB- -- which employs realization classes considerably less abstract than those provided by the upper\nmodel -- with the input required for Penman .4 Figure 1 shows corresponding inputs for the generation of\nthe simple clause : Fluffy is chasing little mice .\nThe appropriate classification of domain knowledge concepts\nsuch as chase , cat , mouse , and little in terms of the\ngeneral semantic types of the upper model -LRB- in this case ,\ndirected-action , object , object , and size respectively - for definitions see : -LSB- Bateman et al. , 1990 -RSB- -RRB- automatically\nprovides information about syntactic realization that\nneeds to be explicitly stated in the MUMBLE-86 input\n-LRB- e.g. , S-V-O_two-explicit-args , rip-common-noun ,\nrestrictive-modifier , adjective -RRB- .\nThus , for example , the classification of a concept mouse as an object in the upper model is sufficient for the grammar\nto consider a realization such as , in MUMBLE-86 terms ,\na general-np with a particular np-common-noun and\naccessories of gender neuter .\nSimilarly , the classification of chase as a directed-action opens up linguistic realization possibilities including clauses with a certain class of transitive verbs and characteristic possibilities for participants , corresponding nominalizations ,\netc. .\nSuch low-level syntactic information is redundent\nfor the PENMANinput .\nThe further domain-independence of the upper model\nis shown in the following example of text generation\ncontrol .\nConsider two rather different domains : a navy\ndatabase of ships and an expert system for digital circuit diagnosis .5 The navy data base contains information concerning ships , submarines , ports , geographical\nregions , etc. and the kinds of activities that ships , submarines , etc. can take part in .\nThe digital circuit diagnosis expert system contains information about subcomponents of digital circuits , the kinds of connections\nbetween those subcomponents , their possible functions ,\netc. .\nA typical sentence from each domain might be :\ncircuit domain : The faulty system is connected to\nthe input\nnavy domain : The ship which was inoperative is\nsailing to Sasebo\nThe input specifications for both of these sentences\nare shown in Figure 2 .\nThese specifications freely intermix upper model roles and concepts -LRB- e.g. , domain ,\n` Note that this is not intended to single out MUMBL ~ -88 :\nthe problem is quite general ; cf. unification-based fframeworks such as -LSB- McKeown and Paris , 1987 -RSB- , or the Lexical Functional Grammar -LRB- LFG -RRB- - based approach of -LSB- Momma\nand DSrre , 1987 -RSB- .\nAs mentioned above , the current developments within most such approaches are now considering\nextensions similar to that covered by the upper model .\nSThese are , in fact , two domains with which we have had\nexperience generating texts using the upper model .\n"}
